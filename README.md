# bigfix-core-api

A collection of interfaces, structures, methods, and functions to provide
a robust and layered interface to the BigFix Core API. This does not provide
implementation of APIs for Inventory, Compliance, Server Automation, etc.
There may be additional libraries in the future that implement these.
